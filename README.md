# aur-ask
A tool to interact with the arch user repository (aur)

this is a tool that people who want to attempt to make aur-helpers or other projects that might invole the aur without them having to write the code themselves!

This project isn't fully completed and I will not provided documentation and/or support until it is completed!

some notice this project is meant to be a dependence for [aurpm](github.com/harvey298/aurpm) so I can keep everything tidy over there and I won't have to rewrite it again so the code is easy to read and easily debugable! 

### Installation
you can type """make""" assuming you have """base-devel""" installed on your arch system


### Documentation
as of right now the Documentation isn't fully complete!
